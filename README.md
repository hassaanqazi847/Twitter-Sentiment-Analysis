**Twitter Sentiment Analysis using LSTMs**

📌 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on Twitter sentiment analysis by leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The goal is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on their textual content. Twitter data contains slang, abbreviations, and emojis, which makes sentiment classification a challenging and interesting Natural Language Processing (NLP) task.

🎯 **Objectives**

- Preprocess raw Twitter text (cleaning, tokenization, embeddings).

- Train an LSTM model for sequence classification.

- Evaluate the model’s performance using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

- Provide predictions for unseen tweets.

---

🔧 **Data Preprocessing**

- Text Cleaning
    - Removed stopwords, URLs, mentions (@user), hashtags (#topic), numbers, and special characters.
    - Converted text to lowercase.
    - Handled emojis and contractions.

- Tokenization & Padding
    - Tokenized tweets into word sequences.
    - Applied padding to ensure equal input lengths.

🤖 **Model Architecture (LSTM)**

- The sentiment classifier is built using Keras/TensorFlow with the following architecture:

- Embedding Layer – converts tokens into dense vectors.

- LSTM Layer(s) – captures sequential dependencies and contextual meaning.

- Dense Layer (Softmax Activation) – outputs class probabilities.

- Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- Optimizer: Adam
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

📦 **Dependencies**

- TensorFlow / Keras

- NumPy

- Pandas

- Matplotlib / seaborn

🌍 **Real-World Applications**

 - **Business & Marketing** 🏢 – Companies analyze customer feedback and brand mentions to improve products and campaigns.

 - **Politics & Elections** 🗳 – Measuring public opinion on leaders, parties, or policies in real time.

 - **Finance & Stock Market** 📈 – Sentiment-driven trading algorithms use social media opinions to predict stock price movements or cryptocurrency trends.

 - **Customer Support** 💬 – Identifying negative feedback quickly to provide faster responses and improve user satisfaction.

 - **Entertainment & Media** 🎬 – Tracking audience reactions to movies, shows, music, or events.

 - **Crisis Management** 🚨 – Governments and NGOs monitor sentiments during natural disasters, pandemics, or emergencies to understand public concerns.

**Conclusion**

In this project, we successfully built a Twitter Sentiment Analysis model using LSTMs to classify tweets into positive, negative, and neutral categories. By applying data preprocessing, tokenization, and word embeddings, the model was able to capture the context of informal Twitter text effectively. The LSTM architecture proved useful in handling sequential dependencies in language, delivering reliable sentiment predictions.
This work highlights the potential of deep learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially in domains where understanding human opinions is critical. While the model already performs well, it can be further enhanced by experimenting with BiLSTMs, GRUs, or transformer-based models like BERT. Deploying the system as a real-time web app connected to the Twitter API could make it highly practical for businesses, researchers, and policymakers.
In short, this project demonstrates how AI and deep learning can transform raw social media data into actionable insights, opening opportunities for smarter decision-making in various sectors.
