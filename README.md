Twitter Sentiment Analysis using LSTMs
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on Twitter sentiment analysis by leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The goal is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on their textual content. Twitter data contains slang, abbreviations, and emojis, which makes sentiment classification a challenging and interesting Natural Language Processing (NLP) task.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Preprocess raw Twitter text (cleaning, tokenization, embeddings).

Train an LSTM model for sequence classification.

Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Provide predictions for unseen tweets.
